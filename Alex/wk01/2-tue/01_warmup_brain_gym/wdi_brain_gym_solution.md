## Question One

You stand at a fork in the road. Next to each of the two forks, there stands a
guard. You know the following things: First that one path leads to paradise, the
other leads to Death. You cannot distinguish between the two paths. You also
know that one of the two guards always tells the truth and the other always
lies. You have permission to ask one guard one question to discover which path
leads to paradise. What one question would you ask to guarantee you take the
path to paradise?

```
Answer: Ask one of the gaurds 'Which door would the other guard say leads to
paradise?' If you ask the truthful one he will say the lying guard would say the
wrong door. If you ask the lying guard he would say the truthful gaurd would
pick the wrong door as well (since he is lying). So no matter what you could
choose the door opposite of what they say and end up in paradise.
```

## Question Two
