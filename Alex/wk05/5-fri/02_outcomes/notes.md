- One page vs Multi page resume / Space issue (How large to make your resume)
  * one page:
    + Self-explanatory career history; same role for extended period of time

  * Inconsistent typesetting
  * Sloppy design/poorly designed
  * Too many pages
  * Poor grammar
  * Bad writing
  * Same bullets for every job
  * Objective does not match job description
  * Cover Letter is for a different job!
  * No job descriptions / achievements at all

- Pictures or no Pictures?
  + Advised against it!

- Good vs Bad examples of Resumes
  * Interests (over Hobbies); explain how these are relevant

- Cover Letters
  * Is a bridge between yourself and your resume
  * Its a chance to demonstrate:
    + You speak their language; match their culture/humor/etc
    + Clear & coherent communication
    + WHY you want the job (may not always be true, however it still needs to be
      present)

  * Tips:
    + Research & always address it to the right person
      (finding the right person can help build rapport)

    + Tailor your Resume (do not rewrite)

    + No such cover letter template (avoid having a template altogether)

- Q&A
  * Referees not necessary on resumes
    (its common knowledge, and is usually asked for)

  * Over the weekend to prepare and (re)design a resume
