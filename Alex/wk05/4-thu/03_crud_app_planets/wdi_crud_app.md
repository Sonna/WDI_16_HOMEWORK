# Build a CRUD App...any CRUD app

Choose **something you like** and build a CRUD app for it.

**For example**, if you like cars, build an app where users can:
- **Create** cars which you'll store in the database.
- **Read** cars from the database, so users can see what they have added.
- **Update** cars so they can modify a car's info.
- **Delete** cars if they want to remove them.
