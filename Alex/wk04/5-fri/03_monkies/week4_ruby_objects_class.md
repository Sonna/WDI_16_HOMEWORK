Create a `Monkey` class in `monkey.rb`, which has the following attributes:
* `name` - a string, which should be determined by some input
* `species` - a string, which should be determined by some input

And the following methods:
* `eat(food)` - adds a food (a string) to the list of foods eaten

Create another file app.rb to use test out the Monkey class

```ruby

adam.eat('fruit salad')
adam.eat('banana milkshake')
adam.introduce # "Hi my name is Adam. I am a Spider Monkey. I had fruit salad and banana milkshake for brunch"
```
