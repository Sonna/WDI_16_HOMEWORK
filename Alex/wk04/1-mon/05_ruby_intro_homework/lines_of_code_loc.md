# line of code

write a program loc.rb to count and puts the number of lines of code in a file

eg. say you have a file data.txt with the following contents

```
cat
dog
rabbit
```

when I run the program, it should prompt for a filename

```
$ ruby loc.rb
$ Enter filename: data.txt
$ 3 line(s)
```

## hint

lookup `gets` method and the `readlines` method
